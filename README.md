# Random-Password-Generator

## The task
We were tasked with creting a random password generator. The HTML and styling was provided, we then added the JavaScript to actually generate the password. A simple, but very useful little application.

## How it works
The users opens the HTML page in a browser. Once the "Generate Password" button is clicked the user is then asked to input a password length from 8 to 128 characters in length. The user is then asked through a series of prompts whether to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric and/or special characters in the password. Once all selections have been made, a randomly generated password will be displayed in the text box that can be copied and used by the user.
